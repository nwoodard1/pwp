* Under the profession section try to elaborate more on the the details or her career and aspects of the job that relate more specifically to the purpose of your website. Some of what you wrote may be more applicable to the frustrations and needs section.
* For the frustrations and needs section it seems like what you have so far is more focused on just the frustrations, try expand on the needs and keep in mind that your website should be the answer to the needs.
* Try to make smaller commits, more frequently. A good rule of thumb is every 15 minutes or 15 lines of code.
* All in all, really good job.
